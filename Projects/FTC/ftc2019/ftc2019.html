            <h2 class="postTitle">Our Robot</h2>
            <p>
                Our robot, Kessler, is a four-wheeled omnibot that has an autonomous system that allows it to score
                points from descending from the lander, color sensing the minerals, and placing down the marker.
                Kessler can also ascend up the lander during end game. Kessler has a linear actuator, which uses
                a motor, a hook, a rod, and gears in order for an arm to reach up and down vertically. The end of
                the actuator has a 3D printed hook that one of our members printed using a CAD program called Inventor
                and a 3D printer. The hook was designed in a way that it could hold 40 pounds and is able to attach
                strongly to the actuator.
            </p><p>
                Other than the actuator, Kessler has a series of sensors that it uses during the autonomous stage.
                These sensors include one color sensors and four distance sensors. The color sensor allow Kessler
                to detect the hue of the minerals presented in a linear orientation at the beginning of the match.
                Reading the hue allows Kessler to identify which of the three minerals presented is gold. By
                identifying the gold mineral, Kessler is programmed to push the gold block off of its current
                position while not pushing the other two silver minerals. Kessler is programmed in its autonomous
                stage to know its position based on the minerals it has passed and which mineral it will push.
                Knowing its position, Kessler is able to move accordingly to the depot from the position it is in
                after pushing the gold block in order to place down the marker. With three possible orientations
                of where the gold block can be placed, we programmed Kessler to move differently towards the depot
                based on where the gold mineral is located. Furthermore, Kessler also pushes the gold mineral into
                the depot, which earns us more points during the autonomous stage automatically.
                Along with the color sensors, Kessler's distance sensors allows it to see the distance between itself
                and the minerals. These distance sensors prevent Kessler from running into the minerals when approaching
                them and allows enough space for the color sensors to read the hue/color of the mineral. With the
                distance sensors, Kessler is able to tell how many minerals it has passed and understand its position
                when it reaches the gold mineral.
            </p><p>
                As an omnibot with four omni wheels, Kessler can move in all four direction, spin, and strafe, thus
                having great maneuverability on the playing field. Kessler's great maneuverability allows it to collect
                the minerals already in the playing field easily into the lander to earn points during the tele-op.
                The omni-wheels are oriented on each of the corners of Kessler, and are angles of 45 degrees in
                respect to the robot's frame.  With some math and sketching, we were able to determine how each of the
                following motors connected to each omni-wheel would spin in order for Kessler to move in the corresponding
                direction.
            </p><p>
                For our collector mechanism, we have a spinner basket connected to an X-rail that allows the minerals to
                be moved up and down vertically.  We have an X-rail attached to plexi glass at the bottom of Kessler.
                A basket that we 3D printed is attached to the X-rail along with a hex axle, a 3D printed surgical
                rubber holder, and a hex motor.  The hex motor is attached to the basket and a the hex axle with the 3D
                printed rubber holder it connected horizontally at the top of the basket in.  The motor would spin the
                axle with the 3D printed part in order to collect minerals into the basket.  The 3D printed surgical
                tube holder hold surgical tubes.  These surgical tubes are both flexible and grippy, which allows the
                spinner to collect minerals into the basket quickly and efficiently.  Our X-rail moves vertically
                whenever its string is pulled, so we attached a second hex motor (one for the collector mechanism and
                one for making the X-rail move up and down).  With a basket that spins in minerals and an X-rail to move
                the basket vertically, we had a mechanism that efficiently collected minerals and dispensed them into the
                lander to score us some points during tele-op.

                The Butterfly Effect, as a team is varying in history from new to veteran. This is the third year for
                team 4284 to have it's cosmic branding. A few members have been together from the beginning of The
                Butterfly Effect, others one or two years, and a few completely new to FTC. Yet, despite some knowing
                more about our goals for the future than others, we all know we want engineering to be in our future.
                A few members already know each other as teammates and friends: Ashley and Jess, for example, were
                members of The Butterfly Effect since its establishment, some members, like Buck, Anthony, Britta, and
                Albert, have been on for two to three years.  A few members, such as Jordan, Daniel, and Jade, are
                completely new to First.
            </p><p>
                Through our outreach within our school, we attracted many new potential members. A few of those people
                decided that the club was something they liked and stuck with us.  Though these members are new, they
                have put effort and dedication to working as a team and their lack of experience did not hold them back
                when trying to problem solve mechanisms of the robot or the code of the autonomous.
