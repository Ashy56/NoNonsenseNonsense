                <b></b> Parachrostia pura is a moth of the Micronoctuidae family.
                It is known from Guizhou in China. The wingspan is 10â€“11 mm. The forewings are narrow.
                The head, thorax and ground colour of the forewings is blackish-grey. All lines are
                black, rather indistinct and waved and the terminal line is well marked by black
                interveinial dots. The reniform stigma is yellow and black outlined. The hindwings are
                unicolourous black-brown with a discal spot. The fringes of both wings are grey. The
                underside is unicolourous grey. The biotope consists of a moist, mainly broad-leaf
                forest, with lianas and shrubs, close to a river. All specimens were captured at light
                in mid September.

                Prepubertal hypertrichosis is a cutaneous condition characterized by increased hair
                growth,[1] and is a relatively common finding in otherwise healthy infants and children,
                most often occurring in individuals of Mediterranean or South Asian descent.[2]
