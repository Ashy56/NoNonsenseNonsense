        <b>Hello!</b> My name is Ashley Biggs and I am a first year computer science student at
        the University of Colorado Boulder. I am a proud FIRST Alumni and mentor for
        the FIRST Tech Challenge team at my old highschool. Now that I am no longer
        leading a team of my own, I am looking to expand my knowlege and refine my
        engineering skills independantly through small projects.

    <h2 class="postTitle">What is this website?</h2>
    <p class="postDescription">
        This portfolio is a combination of my professional, club, and personal projects,
        on teams and independantly (specified on individual project pages). This is
        not a replacement for my resume but a supplement to demonstrate the skills
        I have developed that are not certified but I find to be important.
