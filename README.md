# No Nonsense Nonsense

Hello! My name is Ashley Biggs and I am a first year computer science student at 
the University of Colorado Boulder. I am a proud FIRST Alumni and mentor for the
FIRST Tech Challenge team at my old highschool. Now that I am no longer leading a team of my own, I am looking to expand my knowlege and refine my engineering skills independantly through small projects. 

### What is this website?
This portfolio is a combination of my professional, club, and personal projects, on teams and independantly (specified on individual project pages). This is not a replacement for my resume but a supplement to demonstrate the skills I have developed that are not certified but I find to be important.
